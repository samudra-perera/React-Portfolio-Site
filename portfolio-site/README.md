# Personal Portfolio Webside

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction 

This is my personal portfolio website that was made from scratch, including all the styling, logos, and image assets. I created this website since my previous personal site was made from a static site generator (cargo.site) and the customizability was incredibly limited. The purpose of this site is for potential employers and recruiters to see my front-end development skills, learn about me, and link them to my previous projects.

## Application Goals

- Smooth and Beautiful UX/U!
- Animations
- Display all the work I have completed thus far
- Easy to modify in the future

## Installation

**Packages Used:** React Spring, React TypeWriter, React Scroll

Prior to running this project on your machine please do the following in your terminal. 
```
npm install 
```
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
 
 ## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS

**Client Side**

The front end of this application is being rendered by the templating language EJS. The EJS is rendered using the database information as inputs. We have used for loops and forEach array methods to iterate through the database responses and render the information to the EJS templates.

## Further Optimizations

After completing the project there are some optimization we would do. 

1. Slight Change to the styling

2. SEO Optimization

## Future Consideration

1. Adding a contact form, still unsure about the effectiveness of these forms

## Lessons Learned:
Building this project from scratch taught me a lot about UX/UI design. It also taught me the effectiveness of designing UI components and how it increases the modularity of the code. I also learned to add animations using React Hooks to enhance the experience of the visitor.
