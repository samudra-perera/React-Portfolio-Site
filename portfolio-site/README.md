# Personal Portfolio Webside

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction 

This is my personal portfolio website completely made from scratch using react components and react hooks. This means all the UI components and the UI functionality was programmed from scratch. I created this website since my previous personal site was made from a static site generator (cargo.site) and the customizability was incredibly limited. The first iteration of this site was completed in (Sep 2022). The most recent iteration of this site was completed on (Jan 2023). The purpose of this site is for potential employers and recruiters to see my front-end development skills, learn about me, and link them to my previous projects.

## Application Goals

- Smooth and Beautiful UX/UI
- Animations
- Display all the work I have completed thus far
- Easy to modify in the future

## First Iteration (Completed Sep 2022)

The first iteration of the website was a react single page web application. The website had no routing and all the components were placed in root component. A simple gif of the site look and functionality can be seen below.

## Second Iteration (Updated Jan 2023)

The second iteration of the website turned the application from a SWA (single page web application) to a react application with pages routed from the navigation. The pages are routed using react-router-dom and browser routing. Furthermore, new UI components were made from scratch (About me accordians, filter projects by language, work experience components). 

## Installation

**Packages Used:** create-react-app, react-router-dom

Prior to running this project on your machine please do the following in your terminal. 
```
npm install 
```
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
 
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ReactJS

**Client Side**

The front end of this application is written in reactJS.

## Further Optimizations

After completing the project there are some optimization we would do. 

1. (Sept 2022) - Slight Change to the styling **(completed)**

2. (Sept 2022) - SEO Optimization

3. (Sept 2022) - Ability to filter projects based on language used **(completed)**

4. (Jan 2023) - New updated site needs to be further optimized for mobile screens

5. (Jan 2023) - Create a more prompted feel for the project filtering system

## Future Consideration

1. Adding a contact form, still unsure about the effectiveness of these forms 

2. Adding a project page for each individual project card

## Lessons Learned:
- (Sept 2022) - Building this project from scratch taught me a lot about UX/UI design. It also taught me the effectiveness of designing UI components and how it increases the modularity of the code. I also learned to add animations using React Hooks to enhance the experience of the visitor.  
- (Jan 2022) - Learned to create the browser router to route the visitor to different pages and render the correct components. Learned the logic to create UI components from scratch.
