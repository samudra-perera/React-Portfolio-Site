        question: "Why did I switch careers?",
        answer: "In truth, leaving my old career was not an easy decision. Working in construction was one of the most rewarding thing I have done in my life. I met so many great people who helped me progress in my career and some have fundamentally challenged the way I view life and work. However, with that said I felt a largely disconnected from my work and had a hard time rationalizing a lot of legacy practices that existed within civil engineering. So came my decision to pursue software engineering; a domain of constant innovation and boundless oppurtunity."

    {
        question: "My goals as a software engineer",
        answer: "Im a mission driven developer looking to jump into a full time role and make an impact right away. I am comfortable working on both the front and back end or across the full stack. Ideally I would love to work at a start up and gain insights on how to start and run a business while contributing to the technology. My key areas of interest are in fintech, cleantech and blockchain development, but I am open to interesting opportunities to make a positive impact in other areas. "

    {
        question: "Hobbies and Interests",
        answer: "Outside of tech, I enjoy playing sports, going to the gym, hanging out with my friends, watching anime, and reading books (Check out my Goodreads to see what I'm currently reading ^ _ ^)."
