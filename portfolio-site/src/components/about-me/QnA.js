        question: "Who am I?",
        answer: "I am a civil turned software engineer based in the Greater Toronto Area. I graduated from the University of Waterlooâ€™s Civil Engineering program in 2021 with a focus on structural engineering with a minor in management. As a natural-born tinkerer, engineering was the obvious choice of career for me. I love spending time working through problems, thinking about abstract topics, and imagining ways to apply new ideas in the real world (ie. my work term report on using blockchain to increase transparency in civil engineering). "

        question: "Why did I switch careers?",
        answer: "In truth, leaving my old career was not an easy decision. Working in construction was one of the most rewarding thing I have done in my life. I met so many great people who helped me progress in my career and some have fundamentally challenged the way I view life and work. However, with that said I felt a largely disconnected from my work and had a hard time rationalizing a lot of legacy practices that existed within civil engineering. So came my decision to pursue software engineering; a domain of constant innovation and boundless oppurtunity."

    {
        question: "My goals as a software engineer",
        answer: "Im a mission driven developer looking to jump into a full time role and make an impact right away. I am comfortable working on both the front and back end or across the full stack. Ideally I would love to work at a start up and gain insights on how to start and run a business while contributing to the technology. My key areas of interest are in fintech, cleantech and blockchain development, but I am open to interesting opportunities to make a positive impact in other areas. "

    {
        question: "Hobbies and Interests",
        answer: "Outside of tech, I enjoy playing sports, going to the gym, hanging out with my friends, watching anime, and reading books (Check out my Goodreads to see what I'm currently reading ^ _ ^)."
